Part 1: Data Processing in Pandas

=== Instructions ===

There are 22 questions in this part.
For each part you will implement a function (q1, q2, etc.)
Each function will take as input a data frame
or a list of data frames and return the answer
to the given question.

To run your code, you can run `python3 part1.py`.
This will run all the questions that you have implemented so far.
It will also save the answers to part1-answers.txt.

=== Dataset ===

In this part, we will use a dataset of world university rankings
called the "QS University Rankings".

The ranking data was taken 2019--2021 from the following website:
https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2021

=== Grading notes ===

- Once you have completed this part, make sure that
  your code runs, that part1-answers.txt is being re-generated
  every time the code is run, and that the answers look
  correct to you.

- Be careful about output types. For example if the question asks
  for a list of DataFrames, don't return a numpy array or a single
  DataFrame. When in doubt, ask on Piazza!

- Make sure that you remove any NotImplementedError exceptions;
  you won't get credit for any part that raises this exception
  (but you will still get credit for future parts that do not raise it
  if they don't depend on the previous parts).

- Make sure that you fill in answers for the parts
  marked "ANSWER ___ BELOW" and that you don't modify
  the lines above and below the answer space.

- Q6 has a few unit tests to help you check your work.
  Make sure that you removed the `@pytest.mark.skip` decorators
  and that all tests pass (show up in green, no red text!)
  when you run `pytest part3.py`.

===== Questions 1-6: Getting Started =====

To begin, let's load the Pandas library.
"""

import pandas as pd

"""
1. Load the dataset into Pandas

Our first step is to load the data into a Pandas DataFrame.
We will also change the column names
to lowercase and reorder to get only the columns we are interested in.

Implement the rest of the function load_input()
by filling in the parts marked TODO below.

Return as your answer to q1 the number of dataframes loaded.
(This part is implemented for you.)
"""

NEW_COLUMNS = ['rank', 'university', 'region', 'academic reputation', 'employer reputation', 'faculty student', 'citations per faculty', 'overall score']

def load_input():
    """
    Input: None
    Return: a list of 3 dataframes, one for each year.
    """

    # Load the input files and return them as a list of 3 dataframes.
    df_2019 = pd.read_csv('data/2019.csv', encoding='latin-1')
    df_2020 = pd.read_csv('data/2020.csv', encoding='latin-1')
    df_2021 = pd.read_csv('data/2021.csv', encoding='latin-1')

    # Standardizing the column names
    df_2019.columns = df_2019.columns.str.lower()
    df_2020.columns = df_2019.columns.str.lower()
    df_2021.columns = df_2019.columns.str.lower()

    # Restructuring the column indexes
    # Fill out this part. You can use column access to get only the
    # columns we are interested in using the NEW_COLUMNS variable above.

    # As the "answer" to this part, let's just return the number of dataframes.
    # Check that your answer shows up in part1-answers.txt.
    return len(dfs)

"""
2. Input validation

Let's do some basic sanity checks on the data for Q1.

Check that all three data frames have the same shape,
and the correct number of rows and columns in the correct order.

As your answer to q2, return True if all validation checks pass,
and False otherwise.
"""

def q2(dfs):
    """
    Input: Assume the input is provided by load_input()

    Return: True if all validation checks pass, False otherwise.

    Make sure you return a Boolean!
    From this part onward, we will not provide the return
    statement for you.
    You can check that the "answers" to each part look
    correct by inspecting the file part1-answers.txt.

"""
===== Interlude: Checking your output so far =====

Run your code with `python3 part1.py` and open up the file
output/part1-answers.txt to see if the output looks correct so far!

You should check your answers in this file after each part.

You are welcome to also print out stuff to the console
in each question if you find it helpful.

===== End of interlude =====

3a. Input validation, continued

Now write a validate another property: that the set of university names
in each year is the same.
As in part 2, return a Boolean value.
(True if they are the same, and False otherwise)

Once you implement and run your code,
remember to check the output in part1-answers.txt.

Did the checks pass or fail?

"""
4a. Random sampling

Now that we have the input data validated, let's get a feel for
the dataset we are working with by taking a random sample of 5 rows
at a time.

Implement q4() below to sample 5 points from each year's data.

As your answer to this part, return the 5 samples *for 2021 only*
as a list.

Code design: You can use a for for loop to iterate over the dataframes.
If df is a DataFrame, df.sample(5) returns a random sample of 5 rows.

    # Sample 5 rows from each dataframe

5. Data cleaning

Let's see where we stand in terms of null values.
We can do this in two different ways.
First, use .info() to see the number of non-null values in each column
displayed in the console.

Then, write a version using .count() to return the number of null values
in each column as a dictionary.

In both 5a and 5b: return as your answer
as a list of the number of non-null values in each column.

===== Interlude again: Unit tests =====

Unit tests

Now that we have completed a few parts,
let's talk about unit tests.
We won't be using them for the entire assignment
(in fact we won't be using them after this),
but they can be a good way to ensure your work is correct
without having to manually inspect the output.

We need to import pytest first.
"""

import pytest

"""
The following are a few unit tests for Q1-5.

To run the unit tests,
first, remove (or comment out) the `@pytest.mark.skip` decorator
from each unit test (function beginning with `test_`).

===== Questions 18-19: Correlation matrices =====

We're almost done!

Let's look at another useful tool to get an idea about how different variables are corelated to each other. We call it a **correlation matrix**

A correlation matrix provides a correlation coefficient (a number between -1 and 1) that tells how strongly two variables are correlated. Values closer to -1 mean strong negative correlation whereas values closer to 1 mean strong positve correlation. Values closer to 0 show variables having no or little correlation.
