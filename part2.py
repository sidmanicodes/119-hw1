Part 2: Performance Comparisons

**Released: Wednesday, October 16**

In this part, we will explore comparing the performance
of different pipelines.
First, we will set up some helper classes.
Then we will do a few comparisons
between two or more versions of a pipeline
to report which one is faster.
"""

import part1

"""
=== Questions 1-5: Throughput and Latency Helpers ===

We will design and fill out two helper classes.

The first is a helper class for throughput (Q1).
The class is created by adding a series of pipelines
(via .add_pipeline(name, size, func))
where name is a title describing the pipeline,
size is the number of elements in the input dataset for the pipeline,
and func is a function that can be run on zero arguments
which runs the pipeline (like def f()).

The second is a similar helper class for latency (Q3).

1. Throughput helper class

Fill in the add_pipeline, eval_throughput, and generate_plot functions below.

Now that we have our helpers, let's do a simple comparison.

===== Questions 6-10: Performance Comparison 1 =====

For our first performance comparison,
let's look at the cost of getting input from a file, vs. in an existing DataFrame.

6. We will use the same population dataset
that we used in lecture 3.

Load the data using load_input() given the file name.

- Make sure that you clean the data by removing
  continents and world data!
  (World data is listed under OWID_WRL)

Then, set up a simple pipeline that computes summary statistics
for the following:

- *Year over year increase* in population, per country

    (min, median, max, mean, and standard deviation)

How you should compute this:

- For each country, we need the maximum year and the minimum year
in the data. We should divide the population difference
over this time by the length of the time period.

- Make sure you throw out the cases where there is only one year
(if any).

- We should at this point have one data point per country.

- Finally, as your answer, return a list of the:
    min, median, max, mean, and standard deviation
  of the data.

Hints:
You can use the describe() function in Pandas to get these statistics.
You should be able to do something like
df.describe().loc["min"]["colum_name"]

to get a specific value from the describe() function.

You shouldn't use any for loops.
See if you can compute this using Pandas functions only.
"""

    # Return a dataframe containing the population data
    # **Clean the data here**

"""
7. Varying the input size

Next we want to set up three different datasets of different sizes.

Create three new files,
    - data/population-small.csv
      with the first 600 rows
    - data/population-medium.csv
      with the first 6000 rows
    - data/population-single-row.csv
      with only the first row
      (for calculating latency)

You can edit the csv file directly to extract the first rows
(remember to also include the header row)
and save a new file.

Make four versions of load input that load your datasets.
(The _large one should use the full population dataset.)

Create baseline pipelines

First let's create our baseline pipelines.

9.
Finally, let's compare whether loading an input from file is faster or slower
than getting it from an existing Pandas dataframe variable.

Create four new dataframes (constant global variables)
directly in the script.

    fromvar_small
    fromvar_medium
    fromvar_large
    fromvar_latency

===== Questions 11-14: Performance Comparison 2 =====

Our second performance comparison will explore vectorization.

Operations in Pandas use Numpy arrays and vectorization to enable
fast operations.
In particular, they are often much faster than using for loops.

Let's explore whether this is true!

11.
First, we need to set up our pipelines for comparison as before.

We already have the baseline pipelines from Q8,
so let's just set up a comparison pipeline
which uses a for loop to calculate the same statistics.

Create a new pipeline:
- Iterate through the dataframe entries. You can assume they are sorted.
- Manually compute the minimum and maximum year for each country.
- Add all of these to a Python list. Then manually compute the summary
  statistics for the list (min, median, max, mean, and standard deviation).

This question is optional.

Use your pipeline to compare something else!

Here are some ideas for what to try:
- the cost of random sampling vs. the cost of getting rows from the
  DataFrame manually
- the cost of cloning a DataFrame
- the cost of sorting a DataFrame prior to doing a computation
- the cost of using different encodings (like one-hot encoding)
  and encodings for null values
- the cost of querying via Pandas methods vs querying via SQL

  pandasql that can run SQL queries on Pandas data frames. See:
